These are pointers rather than complete notes on installation.

# Requirements

The install.sh and similar scripts in the src/sql folder assist
installing the PostgreSQL database (12 minimum version supported).

Several files need updating to include database strings etc.
These include:

  - src/NZGBplugin/Plugin.py <server>
    is url of the web server from which the plugin is delivered

  - src/sql/gazetteer_roles.sql
    '********' is a password by the "web application"
    (not part of this repository)

  - src/setenv.sh
    Install the credentials for dev, uat, and prod databases
